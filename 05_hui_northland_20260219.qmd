Introducing the stereo baited remote underwater video

Each unit comprises a stainless steel frame with two video cameras, lights, a depth and temperature sensor, and a canister of fresh bait sticking out the front.

We have six of these units, and we throw them into the sea and leave them for just over an hour. The bait attracts fish and other animals, and we can count the organisms and record the habitat.

This has become a standard tool for monitoring fishes internationally. I've used these things for several years across New Zealand from the Kermadecs to Fiordland, as well as in several other countries, the Galapagos Islands, New Caledonia, Fiji. 

We also used this method in a global study of sharks called Global FinPrint, which surveyed sharks on coral reefs all over the world.

Why stereo? This one of the reasons why this method is so powerful...

After calibrating a stereo BRUV with a special hardware and software, 

you can take accurate measurements of the lenghts of fish and other objects.

Much like our having two eyes allow to perceive depths.

## Advantages of BRUVs

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"} 

- Cost-effective
- Non-destructive, non-lethal
- Globally established methodology
- Standardised observation period (60 min)
- Broad depth range
- Captures a wealth of information on multiple species, size-classes, and habitats
- Permanent video archive

So, what are some of the advantages of this method?

It's non-destructive. No fish were harmed to bring you these data.

Because it's cost effective and non-destructive, we can do it more frequently.

It's globally established, standardised methodology. I was a co-author on a published paper that established the standardised methods.

They can access all sorts of habitats at a broad range of depths. We've sent some systems down to 1200 metres (not these ones). 

They'll record anything that goes near a BRUV, all species of all sizes, as well as habitat information. 

The fact that we have all this geographical and habitat information means that we can figure out what which areas and habitats are important to blue cod populations, at different parts of their life history.

Finally, all the videos are stored in a permanent archive. We've extracted the data that we want, but the future opportunities are endless. These videos will likely be mined for information and projects we haven't even thought of yet.

## Our survey 

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="30%"}

- Surveyed fish and habitats in/around the Rakaumangamanga Rāhui Tapu no-take area
- 42 deployments in 2 days (contracted to do 36) in April 2025
- Four levels of protection
- The goal was to assess biodiversity and, in particular, abundance and size of tāmure

We got a lot done, thanks largely to the great crew that we had in the field

Tāmure > 450 cm found *only* in the area protected since 2010.

Legal-size tāmure found mostly in the rāhui tapu, including newly protected area.

Rapid increase in legal-sized tāmure often observed in no-take areas. 

How?

::: notes

- Within a year or two
- Large snapper move inshore in the summer where, in fished waters, they are mostly caught
- In the rāhui tapu, they are protected from fishing, they remain.
- Not a case of the fish already being there and just growing up; rather, it's a story of recolonisation — fish moving in from offshore stock and setting up territories on reefs.
