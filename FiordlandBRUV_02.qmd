  data-notes: "Hello. By way of introduction, some of you might know me from when I worked in the NIWA fisheries modelling group at Greta Point in 2006-8. I left NIWA to do my PhD and have been lecturing statistics at Massey University in Auckland ever since. I'm still lecturing at Massey, but last year I started my own business called Sea Thr Sci, for which I do statistical consulting and marine fieldwork, usually with baited remote underwater video, or BRUVs. Today, I'll be describing the method and why I and several other folks think it has some promise for monitoring fish stocks in Fiordland."
