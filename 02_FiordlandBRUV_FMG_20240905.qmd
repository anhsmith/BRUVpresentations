Introduce myself
I am a statistician and marine ecologist
I am a lecturer in statistics at Massey University in Auckland
I’m Director of Sea Through Science, a company I started last year for statistical consulting and marine ecological research
In the past I’ve worked 
as a statistician at the Department of Conservation in Christchurch, (although I now live in Orewa north of Auckland, I am a mainlander)
in the fisheries modelling group in NIWA, 
To cut a long story short, I’ve spent the last 20 something years counting fish and analysing data
I first came to Fiordland in 2005, briefly ducking into Preservation Inlet during a survey of Foveaux Strait on the Renown led by Helen Kettles, and then again in 2006 during a fairly comprehensive underwater survey on the Southern Winds. Erin Green and I were the only two to see a great white shark join us briefly for a survey near Clio Rocks in Bligh Sound, a story some of you might have heard.

## Protecting fish stocks 

![](img/bluecod.jpg){.absolute top=120 right=0 width="35%"}

:::{.incremental}

- Seems like the right thing to do
- Requires good information on:
    - the current state of populations
    - population trends through time
- But... counting fish ain't easy!
- Many methods available

:::


::: notes

Current state of populations -- important metrics such as total biomass or density of individuals, or the size and sex structure of the population

Population trends through time are important, especially when there are changes to regulations. For trends, we need regular monitoring. The more often we survey, the more information we have on trends. There's no substitute.

Monitoring fish is hard -- trust me, I've spent most of my career counting fish and analysing the data. Fish are tricky because they're hard to see and they move around a lot. There are all sorts of constraints.

## Which methods are appropriate?

![](img/bluecod.jpg){.absolute top=120 right=0 width="35%"}

Depends entirely on the context:

::: {style="font-size: 90%;"}

- Objectives
- Costs and budget
- Constraints of the physical environment and organisms' biology 
- Quality and quantity of information provided by the method
- Impacts of the method on the ecosystem

:::

::: notes

Objectives -- everything stems from objectives. It's no use just going out and count stuff. We need to keep front of mind exactly what we wish to measure and why. 

This question of objectives is one of the main reasons why I really wanted to come down here and talk with you -- to get a better idea of what we need to know

A full stock assessment -- which can estimate the total biomass of a stock through time -- requires a truckload of data, including commercial catch data and usually fishery-independent data going back years.

::: notes

The last potting survey of blue cod in Fiordland was a decade ago.

Such losses may be ok for wider fisheries where hundreds of tonnes are taken annually, but in a sensitive, enclosed environment like the fiords, this is an unacceptably crude and destructive method

It is not fit for purpose

Which is why the Guardians...

flow <- tibble::tibble(

## Our work {#all-white background-image="img/sw.jpg"}

In 2021 and 2024, the Department of Conservation supported BRUV surveys of Fiordland.

Ministry for Primary Industries funded the annotation of the 2024 videos.


## Fiordland 2021

```{r}
#| echo: false
library(mapview)
map_fiordland21 <- readRDS("map/map_fiordland21.rds")
map_fiordland21
```

90 deployments at 10-95 m depths.


## Tamatea/Dusky Sound 2024

```{r}
#| echo: false
library(mapview)
map_fiordland24 <- readRDS("map/map_fiordland24.rds")
map_fiordland24
```

136 deployments at 15-86 m depths.

This is the "MaxN" count, which is the highest number seen on a single frame of the video
Highest number observed on a single frame was 38
Average was 5.5 individuals

We saw hapuku at 10 sites, only one or two individuals at each

## Advantages of BRUVs

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"} 

- Cost-effective
- Non-destructive, non-lethal
- Globally established methodology
- Standardised observation period (60 min)
- Broad depth range
- Captures a wealth of information on multiple species, size-classes, habitats, all stored in a permanent video archive

:::

::: {.column width="60%"}

:::

:::

::: notes

Much cheaper than a potting survey.

The fact that we have geographical and habitat information means that we can figure out what which areas are important to blue cod populations

Anything that goes near a BRUV will be recorded

:::


## Disadvantages of BRUVs {.h2right}

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}

![Photo credit: C. Rob Priester](img/carry.jpg)

:::

::: { .column width="60%"} 

- Expensive upfront costs of gear
- Unknown 'catchment' area of bait plume
- Some deployments fail
- Lack of historical baseline
- Cannot tell the sex of non-sexually dimorphic species (e.g., blue cod)

:::

:::

::: notes

Annotation is the process of watching the videos and recording data on abundance, length, habitat, etc. We don't call this 'analysis' so as not to confuse it with statistical analysis of the data.

:::

## Recommendations

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}

::: {.incremental}

- Annotation of the 2021 data (at least for sites repeated in 2024) 

- Statistical analysis and reporting for key species

- Ongoing monitoring of Tamatea/Dusky Sound (say, every 2 years)

- Comparison of potting data with BRUV data

- Exploration of the potential for BRUVs to provide fishery-relevant information

::: notes

More regular monitoring is possible due to the cost-effective, non-destructive nature of the method

Details of what information is required for fishery management and comparing the ability of available methods to provide this information as part of an overall cost-benefit analysis.

## The future [afid.io](https://www.afid.io/) {background-video="vid/AFID.mp4" background-video-loop="true"}

::: notes
In talks with [afid.io](https://www.afid.io/) to develop machine learning for annotating NZ BRUV videos,<br>which would reduce the costs further!

## Remaining questions

![](img/bruv.png){.absolute bottom=50 right=0 height="42%"}
![](img/ReefCodScar.png){.absolute bottom=50 left=0 height="42%"}



- Objectives
- Funding
- Other sources of data (e.g. Fish Mainland)

::: notes

Much like planting trees, the best time to start a good monitoring programme is 20 years ago, the second best time to start a good monitoring programme is right now.
And that’s what we’ve done.

The trouble is 
- MPI is focused on managing stocks that are commercially harvested; blue cod are not commercially harvested in this area so MPI doesn’t really seem that interested
- DOC are very supportive but they have a tonne of projects competing for limited funding and resources

Collect potting and BRUV data from the same sites
Collect data from recreational fishery?
