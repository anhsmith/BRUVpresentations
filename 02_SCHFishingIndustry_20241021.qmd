  I am a statistician and marine scientist. I've been around for a while. 
  In the 2000s, I worked at DOC as a statistician and in NIWA's fisheries modelling group.
  Since 2009 I went to Massey University to do my PhD and have been lecturing statistics
  there every since. 
  
  About a year ago, I started a company called Sea Through Science, which I do 
  statistical consulting and marine ecology work, notably, using baited underwater
  video surveys in Fiordland and the Hauraki Gulf. This video here is from our 
  survey in Dusky Sound.
  
  Many of you know Alex Burton, my shark-mad PhD student. His other supervisors are Clinton Duffy,
  John Harrison and Marie-Anne Thelen. Marc Griffiths is an advisor at FNZ, which 
  funded his project. Alex is currently on the home straight, writing up his 
  thesis.

*Support from Sanford, Egmont Seafoods, Talleys, Pelco, Observer Programme, NIWA, Tindale Marine Research, and others.*

::: notes

This is one of the broadest PhD theses I've seen. To be honest, it is closer to 
two theses than one. Most have only three data chapters, whereas Alex has five.

I wanted to acknowlege the support we've had already -- bottom of slide

I circulated to you a document in my original email which summarises each chapter. 
Alex would be more than happy to answer any questions you may have on the other chapters.

But I'm just going to show you a couple of results from the fourth chapter, 
which looked at the movements of school sharks caught in the Kaipara Harbour, 
a known nursery.

## Movements of school sharks

![](img/MiniPAT.png){.absolute top="0%" right="0%" width="15%"}

We fit 25 mini-PAT tags to large females in the Kaipara Harbour.

Mini-PATs logged data for a year, then popped of and transmitted data to satellite.

::: notes

These are neat little contraptions. They're basically data loggers that record
depth, temperature and light. You can programme them to pop off after, say, a year
then they transmit their data to us via a satellite, and you can see what the 
animal has been up to.

::: notes

Here is a sample of the tracks that were made by sharks caught in January 2022.
Remember these are all large females caught in the Kaipara. 
There are two very interesting tracks. 
One went to the Three Kings Islands, and one went all the way to the Snares Islands!

The picture on the right is a heatmap, produced by an analysis 
called kernel density estimation applied to the tracks from multiple sharks, 
including some that went to the west coast of the south island.

It shows that the sharks showed residency behaviour (as opposed to travelling) 
in three distinct areas: Northland, Northern Taranaki Bight, and just north of
Cook Strait. 

These are very likely to be feeding grounds.

## Plenty more to do...

![](img/schoolshark.jpg){.absolute top=0 right=0 height="15%"}

- Alex's PhD addressed many of the research priorities outlined in the 2024 plenary
but there are still plenty of gaps!
- We now seek partnerships and funding to extend this research

::: notes

Now that Alex is nearing the end of his studies, we're looking for ways to 
keep doing this important research.

:::


## Why now? 

![](img/schoolshark.jpg){.absolute top=0 right=0 height="15%"}

#### 1. More information leads to more confident management

- Most school shark fisheries have collapsed worldwide
- NZ is doing okay but there is some concern, particularly in Southland
- International organisations have their eyes on school sharks
    - Recent IUCN[^1] classification as "globally Critically Endangered"
    - Appendix 2 of CMS[^2]
    - CITES[^3]?

[^1]: International Union for Conservation of Nature
[^2]: Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals
[^3]: Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora

::: notes

There is increasing scrutiny of the fishery by these international conventions, 
to which NZ is a party and therefore must abide by their rulings.

If international governing bodies start asking questions about the NZ stock 
and the answer is "we don't know", then we won't be in a strong position to 
argue that our fisheries are sustainable. We need to come from a position of 
knowledge.

I don't really want to be scare mongering, but from what I understand, this 
is a real threat to the fishery. It could be closed down overnight if we 
cannot make solid arguments for our fishery being sustainable.

:::

## Why now? 

![](img/schoolshark.jpg){.absolute top=0 right=0 height="15%"}

#### 1. More information leads to more confident management
#### 2. We are perfectly positioned to do the research

- **Expertise**: fisheries, ecology, statistics, chemistry, and Alex is an expert in school sharks
- **Experience**: tried a lot of avenues of research -- we know what works!
- **Networks**: science, industry, fishers, NIWA, DOC, MPI, iwi
- **Access**: data, specimens, world-class molecular labs, necropsy facilities, freezers, etc.
- **New company**
- Heading to Southland in February 2025

## Why now? 

![](img/schoolshark.jpg){.absolute top=0 right=0 height="15%"}

#### 1. More information leads to more confident management
#### 2. We are perfectly positioned to do the research
#### 3. Strong possibility of in-kind funding from MPI

- Sustainable Food and Fibre Futures (SFFF)
- SFFF matches funding from other sectors (cash and/or support)

::: notes

Funding for fisheries research is pretty bad currently -- 
reduced this year after not being increased for decades

Marc thinks we have a good chance of getting funding via SFFF if 
another party comes to the table

SFFF will also match the value of logistical support-boat time, 
donations of specimens, etc.

## We propose to...

![](img/schoolshark.jpg){.absolute top=0 right=0 height="15%"}


![](img/tag_icon.png){.absolute top="15%" left="3%" height="15%"}

[**Tag** more sharks in more areas to understand stock movements]{.absolute top="22%" left="15%"}


![](img/measure.png){.absolute top="35%" left="0%" height="12%"}

[**Measure** sharks to understand biology]{.absolute top="40%" left="15%"}


![](img/dna.png){.absolute top="53%" left="0%" height="12%"}

[**eDNA** samples of cloaca to determine diets]{.absolute top="58%" left="15%"}



![](img/syringe.png){.absolute top="72%" left="0%" height="12%"}

[**Blood** samples to determine condition and reproductive status]{.absolute top="76%" left="15%"}


::: notes

Understanding the stock structure, how these aggregation sites are connected 
and what the sharks are using them for and when, is important, and feeds 
directly into how we do stock assessments. 

For example: Where are the bottlenecks in the population? 
Where are they most vulnerable?
What are the implications for area x if there's a decline in CPUE in area y?

When we're out there catching sharks, we will collect measurements and samples.
- Lengths
- Cloacal swab to determine diets based on DNA content using established methods
- Take blood samples to determine condition and reproductive status, heavy metals

These will be stored in an archive to be analysed, if not now, at a later date.

Together, this information will feed directly into the management of this 
species, and will provide a much more complete picture of the biology and 
ecology of New Zealand's school sharks.

## Summary

![](img/schoolshark.jpg){.absolute top=0 right=0 height="25%"}

#### We seek support from industry
- Funding 
- Logistics (boat time, specimens, etc.)

<br>

#### Then, we'll apply to SFFF for matching funding

<br>

#### We have lots of other ideas!

- The 2024 plenary lists research priorities
    - Improve methods of aging (DNA methylation)
    - Analysis of existing data for stock structure
    - Baited video surveys of aggregation sites


![](img/BRUV.png){.absolute bottom="15%" right=0 height="30%"}

::: notes

The most difficult and expensive part of this sort of research is the field work, 
and being able to catch enough specimens. 

With the help of the industry and fishers, this research becomes imminently viable. 
Alex has made lots of contacts in the industry and they've been very helpful, 
donating specimens and offering to take us out on vessels, etc. 

The purpose of this meeting is gauge the interest of you, the industry,
in providing support in the form of funding and logistics for research 
on school sharks -- research that will directly inform the management 
of this species, and potentially ward off the efforts of international 
agencies to close fisheries of this species worldwide. We can only 
make compelling arguments from an informed position. The bigger the gaps
in our knowledge, they'll default to assuming the worst and make the 
most conservative decisions.

While funding is generally scarce, SFFF might be in play if we can get this
off the ground. 

The great thing about SFFF is that we can include the cash value of the 
logistical support (boat time, specimens, etc.) from industry, so they 
will likely contribute more cash funding than industry.

I haven't approached SFFF yet because I wanted to gauge your interest first.

Of course, we have lots of other ideas for useful research, which we're happy 
to discuss.

These are just some examples:

Keeping a close eye on DNA methylation work in Australia

There's a lot of other data around that could be curated and analysed

We have the non-invasive baited video method which can be used to characterise 
stock size-sex structure, habitat associations, and aggregation sites. 

(In our recent study in Dusky Sound, we saw school sharks in the majority of depl)

So that's all I really wanted to say. Again, what I wish to achieve with this 
meeting is to gauge the level of interest in these proposed proposed research. 

If this is something you think you can support, great, we can talk details. 

If not, then if you want to have a chat about our research, past or future, 
we'd be happy to answer any questions you have.

Thanks -- I'll turn it over to you now.

136 deployments at depths of 15-86 m

::: notes

Then, in 2024, Rich Kinsey at DOC commissioned us to do a more intensive survey of Tamatea/Dusky Sound, for a total of 136 deployments.

:::


## Presence of school shark

![](img/schoolshark.jpg){.absolute top=0 right=0 height="15%"}

![](img/pres_scho.png)

::: notes

I was very surprised at how many school shark we saw throughout the survey -- they appeared in more than half the deployments, and throughout Dusky Sound. Up to around five individuals. My PhD student, Alex Burton, is working on school sharks, so he was very excited to see this. 

We don't see school sharks anywhere close to this regularly in the outer Hauraki Gulf.
