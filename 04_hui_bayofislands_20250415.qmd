  Thank you for being here today<br><br>

  I’m the Director of Sea Through Science, a company I started last year for statistical consulting and marine ecological research<br><br>

  In the past I’ve worked as a statistician at the Department of Conservation and I've also worked in the fisheries modelling group in NIWA. <br><br>
  
  I spent 12 years lecturing statistics at Massey University in Auckland, but I resigned in February to focus full time on Sea Through Science<br><br>

  I'm both a statistician and a marine ecologist. I’ve spent the last 20 something years, including my PhD, collecting data on fish and advancing methods for analysing fish data. <br><br>

  I wanted to say that I love Northland. My brother used to live in kerikeri so I've spent a bit of time here. I've dived a lot, particularly around Home Point, just south of the Bay of Islands, where I was part of a team that did annual dive surveys of fish there.<br><br>
  
  To kick things off today, I've prepared a short presentation to tell you  about the method we'll be using to survey fish, which we call BRUVing. And then I'll talk about the sampling design I've proposed, and the reasons behind it. And then we can have korero and make some decisions.

## What is a 'Stereo BRUV'?

Introducing the stereo baited remote underwater video

Each unit comprises a stainless steel frame with two video cameras, lights, a depth and temperature sensor, and a canister of fresh bait sticking out the front.

We have six of these units, and we throw them into the sea and leave them for just over an hour. The bait attracts fish and other animals, and we can count the organisms and record the habitat.

This has become a standard tool for monitoring fishes internationally. I've used these things for several years across New Zealand from the Kermadecs to Fiordland, as well as in several other countries, the Galapagos Islands, New Caledonia, Fiji. 

We also used this method in a global study of sharks called Global FinPrint, which surveyed sharks on coral reefs all over the world.

Why stereo? This one of the reasons why this method is so powerful...

::: notes

After calibrating a stereo BRUV with a special hardware and software, 

you can take accurate measurements of the lenghts of fish and other objects.

Much like our having two eyes allow to perceive depths.

::: notes

The full process of a BRUV survey involves first calibrating the cameras, which is usually done in a swimming pool. 

Then we go to the field and deploy the BRUVs. 

Each video must be annotated, which is the process of reviewing the footage and 
recording data on abundance, length, habitat, etc. This process takes time, 
sometimes several hours per video, depending on how fishy it is. We call this 
"annotation" rather than "analysis" so it is not confuses with the statistical
analysis of the data. 

Nicola, Richie and I have talked about annotation being something with which 
hapu could get involved. It is a lengthy process, taking up to a few hours per 
video. And it is quite technical. But it quite pleasant to do.

And finally, there is the data analysis and reporting.

With multi-year data, we can examine trends in abundance, size structure, and diversity.

## Advantages of BRUVs

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"} 

- Cost-effective
- Non-destructive, non-lethal
- Globally established methodology
- Standardised observation period (60 min)
- Broad depth range
- Captures a wealth of information on multiple species, size-classes, and habitats
- Permanent video archive

So, what are some of the advantages of this method?

It's non-destructive. No fish were harmed to bring you these data.

Because it's cost effective and non-destructive, we can do it more frequently.

It's globally established, standardised methodology. I was a co-author on a published paper that established the standardised methods.

They can access all sorts of habitats at a broad range of depths. We've sent some systems down to 1200 metres (not these ones). 

They'll record anything that goes near a BRUV, all species of all sizes, as well as habitat information. 

The fact that we have all this geographical and habitat information means that we can figure out what which areas and habitats are important to blue cod populations, at different parts of their life history.

Finally, all the videos are stored in a permanent archive. We've extracted the data that we want, but the future opportunities are endless. These videos will likely be mined for information and projects we haven't even thought of yet.

12 eastern<br>'control' sites

:::


::: notes

The western control sites are inside the bay of islands, so are subject to all the 
environmental influences and human impacts of the bay. 

But, they're along islands, not in mainland bays, like the MPA sites

The eastern control sites are in mainland bays, inside the lesser MPA where commercial fishing is prohibited. but they're not in the bay of islands, and so the environmental influences may be different there

I think this design covers our bases. We'll have an alternative plan in
place in case we can't get round the point to the eastern side. 

________

That's the end of the presentation.

I'll end by saying that I feel very privileged to have been invited into this team. 
And I look forward to our discussions, and ultimately getting this mahi done in partnership with you.
