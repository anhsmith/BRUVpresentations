  data-notes: "Hello. By way of introduction, some of you might know me from when I worked in the NIWA fisheries modelling group at Greta Point in 2006-8. I left NIWA to do my PhD and have been lecturing statistics at Massey University in Auckland since 2013. Alongside my Massey position, last year I started a business called Sea Through Science, for which I do statistical consulting and marine fieldwork, usually with baited remote underwater video, or BRUVs. Today, I'll be describing the method and why I and several other folks think it has some promise for monitoring fish stocks in Fiordland."

## What is a 'Stereo BRUV'?

::: {.columns}

::: {.incremental .column width="40%"} 

- Stereo Baited Remote Underwater Video
- Stainless steel frame with two video cameras pointing at a bait canister, with lights and a depth sensor
- Used around the world as a standard method of monitoring carnivorous fishes
- With two calibrated video cameras and specialist software, can accurately measure lengths

## Blue cod {#all-dark background-image="img/bluecodpot.png"}

Growing concern about the blue cod populations in Fiordland

Blue cod in Fiordland were historically assessed by potting surveys <br>but there's been no formal survey since 2014


## Our work {#all-white background-image="img/sw.jpg"}

In 2021 and 2024, the Department of Conservation supported BRUV surveys of Fiordland.

Ministry for Primary Industries has funded the annotation of the videos.


::: notes

Fiordland's lobster fishery is a great success story, but there are growing concerns about the blue cod populations. 

Traditionally, for fishery-independed surveys blue cod are assessed  surveyed by potting

The last potting survey of blue cod in Fiordland was a decade ago.

## Advantages of BRUVs

::: {.columns}

::: {.incremental .column width="40%"} 

- Broadly supported; non-destructive, non-lethal
- Established methodology
- Rapid replication
- Standardised observation period (60 min)
- Depth range
- Captures information on multiple species, size-classes, habitats
- Permanent video archive

## Disadvantages of BRUVs {.h2right}

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}

![Photo credit: C. Rob Priester](img/carry.jpg)

:::

::: {.incremental .column width="60%"} 

- Expensive upfront costs of gear
- Time-consuming annotation of videos (though AI will soon see to that)
- Provides an index of abundance from an unknown area
- Cannot tell the sex of non-sexually dimorphic specices (e.g., blue cod)
